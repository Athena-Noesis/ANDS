# FAQ

## Is ANDS a benchmark?
No. ANDS classifies system properties and governance—not “who is smartest”.

## Does ANDS guarantee safety?
No. It provides structured disclosure and enables enforcement/audit.

## Why `/.well-known/ands.json`?
It is a standard pattern for machine-readable metadata at a predictable location.

## What if a vendor won't publish it?
Treat the system as unclassified and apply strict restrictions or deny procurement.

## Can the scanner be fooled?
Yes. That's why certification levels exist and why evidence + confidence are required.
