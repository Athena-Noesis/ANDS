## SELF
Vendor self-attestation only.
- Acceptable for low-risk use and evaluation.
- Requires disclaimers and additional review for high-risk categories.

## VERIFIED
Independent verification performed by a qualified reviewer.
- Includes evidence review and configuration validation.
- Suitable for moderate risk deployments.

## AUDITED

- Suitable for high-risk deployments where required by policy/insurance/regulation.

Certification does **not** grant authority; it increases trust in classification accuracy.
