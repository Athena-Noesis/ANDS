1. tools/validate_declaration.py
Intended Use: This script is designed for offline validation of ANDS declaration JSON files. It ensures that a vendor's declaration (typically hosted at /.well-known/ands.json) adheres to the standard schema. It can also perform Ed25519 signature verification to confirm the integrity and authenticity of the declaration if a signature block is provided.

2. tools/ands_scan.py
Intended Use: This is an evidence-gathering scanner for AI systems. It takes a target URL and performs several non-invasive checks:

It attempts to fetch the declared ANDS file.
It scans for an openapi.json file to identify capability hints (e.g., tool use, code execution, RBAC).
It performs optional "verification probes" on common endpoints (e.g., /health, /execute) to check for basic protection (authentication gating).
It outputs a detailed JSON report containing both declared and inferred ANDS codes, a confidence score, and identified gaps/recommendations.
3. tools/report/render_report.py
Intended Use: This utility converts the technical JSON report generated by ands_scan.py into a human-readable Markdown format. This is useful for compliance documentation, audits, or sharing scan results with non-technical stakeholders.
