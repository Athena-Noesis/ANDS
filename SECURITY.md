# Security Policy

This repository contains a public standard specification and reference tooling.
No secrets should ever be committed.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a vulnerability in the reference tooling (e.g., `tools/ands_scan.py`),
please open a security advisory or email the maintainer contact listed in `GOVERNANCE.md`.

## Scope
- In scope: bugs that could lead to command execution, SSRF, credential leakage, or report tampering.
- Out of scope: disputes about ANDS scoring, policy choices, or vendor declarations (use issues/discussions).

## Important Note
ANDS classification is *not* a security guarantee. It is a structured disclosure and auditing mechanism.
