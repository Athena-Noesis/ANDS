# Governance

ANDS is published as an open standard with conservative change control.

## Maintainers
- Athena Noesis (initial steward)

## Principles
- **Stability > novelty**: changes must preserve auditability and avoid ambiguity.
- **Conservative evolution**: add optional fields before adding requirements.
- **No vendor lock-in**: schemas and tools remain open and portable.

## How to Propose Changes
1. Open an issue describing the proposed change and rationale.
2. Include migration impact: who breaks, how to migrate, and default behavior.
3. Provide at least one example and (if relevant) schema/test updates.

## Decision Process
- Minor changes: maintainer approval after public review
- Major changes: require explicit version bump + deprecation plan + public review window
